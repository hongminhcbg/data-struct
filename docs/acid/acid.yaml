ACID:
  automicity: 
    - ˌætəˈmɪsəti
    - read, write, update and detele is single unit
    - entire stament is executed or none
    - prevents data loss
    - if any of the statements is fail, all transactions fail and left database unchange
  Consistency:
    - kənˈsɪstənsi
    - ensures that transactions only make changes to tables in predefined and predictable ways
    - bring database from a valid state to another
  Isolation:
    Sumary:
      - When multiple transactions will execute in same table in the same time
      - TODO 4 level isolation transaction
    four_level_isolation:
      DIRTY_READ:
        - can see data written by uncommitted transaction
      READ_COMMITTED:
        - only see data is written by committed transaction
        - same query might return diff result
      REPEATEABLE_READ:
        - same read query always returns same value
        - data still correct
      SERIALIZABLE:
        - highest isolation but reduce concurrency
  Durability:
    - Once transaction is committed, they will remain committed even system failure (crash, power outage)
    
  Slectivity: Is (select DISTINCT(x)) / COUNT(*), if selectivity is high, we will put the column first in the index
