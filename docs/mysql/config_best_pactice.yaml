open_and_idle_connection:
- object is a pool contains both idle and 'in-use' connections
- a connections is marked as in-use when u are using it to execute data task, like query 
- when task is completed the connection is marked as idle 
- when u need a connectin, sql.DB will first check if any idle connections ara already available in the pool 
- if have no, Go will create new additional connection

setMaxOpenConns:
- total in-use and idle connection
- if set maxOpenConns is 5 and u have 5 connections are in-use, Go will force wait until one of the 5 connections is freed up

setMaxIdleConns:
- by default sql.DB max idle conns is 2
- Maximum number of idle (unused but open) connections to retain in the pool.
