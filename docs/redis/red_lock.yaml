summary:
  - in system, sometimes u must lock a resource. This might be to make critical modifications that can't not be resolved in any conrrent way
  - one and only one worker to be able to acquire the lock
  - can be unlock ater a given time period
savety_and_liveness_guarantees:
  safety: mutual exclusion, one and only one client can hold the lock
  liveness_1: deadlock free, always possible ao accquire a lock, even if the client that locked a resource crashes
  liveness_2: fault tolerance, as long as the master node is up, client can accquire and release lock 
corrent_impl_for_single_instance:
  - query: SET ${{RESOURCE_NAME}} ${{RANDOM_VALUE}} NX PX 30000 (not existed and expired time is 30s)
  - RANDOM_VALUE must be unique across all clients and all lock requests
  - RANDOME_VALUE is very important, if key is expired (client A), another client get the same lock (client B), the client A can release lock of client B 
  - if expired time too short, lock can be release before client call release
the_red_lock_algorithm:
- we assume we have N redis masters 
- get lock from each instace sequentially
- if >= (N/2 + 1) client accquired => get lock success

redis_use_case:
  string: cache static config like banner
  hset: active session, user-versions
  zset: waiting room, FIFO, ZISMEMBER -> (if not found) -> ZADD -> (else) -> ZRANK (get my index) 

key_eviction: (LRU or LFU)

key_space:
  - https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace/
  - Very long keys are not a good idea. For instance a key of 1024 bytes is a bad idea not only memory-wise
data type:
  - hashset: 
      ref: (https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/hashes/)
      content: Redis hashes are record types structured as collections of field-value pairs. You can use hashes to represent basic objects and to store groupings of counters, among other things.
      use-case:
          Active Session Tracking: "Store all active sessions in a hash key. Set each session's TTL to expire automatically after inactivity. Use HLEN to count active sessions."
  - sets:
      ref: https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/sets/
      content: Key only, not support key-val
  - zset:
      ref: https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/sorted-sets/
      conntent: leader board
